## 🧪 Instructions for Testing
Follow these steps to test the core functionalities of the To-Do List application:

1.  **Start the Program:** Run the script (`python todo_list.py`).

2.  **Test 'View tasks' (Initial State):**
    * Enter **2** when the menu appears.
    * **Expected Result:** It should print "No task added yet."

3.  **Test 'Add a task':**
    * Enter **1**.
    * When prompted, enter a task (e.g., "Grocery Shopping").
    * **Expected Result:** It should print "Task added !"
    * Repeat this step a few times to add multiple tasks.

4.  **Test 'View tasks' (With Tasks):**
    * Enter **2**.
    * **Expected Result:** It should display the list of all tasks you added, each numbered starting from 1.

5.  **Test 'Remove a task':**
    * Enter **3**.
    * The task list will be displayed.
    * Enter the number corresponding to a task you wish to remove (e.g., **1** to remove the first task).
    * **Expected Result:** It should print "Removed: [task name]" (Note: Due to a small error in the provided code snippet, the removal message will display the task number minus one, not the task name itself).

6.  **Test 'Exit':**
    * Enter **4**.
    * **Expected Result:** It should print "Exiting..... goodbye!" and the program should terminate.

7.  **Test Invalid Input:**
    * Enter any number or character not between 1 and 4 (e.g., **5** or **a**).
    * **Expected Result:** It should print "Invalid choice .! Please enter 1–4."
